# Introduction
The invention of AI, (More specifically, LLM's) has made converting these recipes to easily accessible markdown easier. 
It is worth noting that It is important to make sure to verify it.

# OpenAI ChatGPT
Didn't work. Gave message `I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I'm unable to directly access or retrieve information from specific URLs. However, if you can provide the main details of the recipe, I'd be happy to assist you in converting them into raw Markdown format.
# Bing Copilot
Bing Copilot works pretty well, although it's on the slow side. It also is inconsistent, sometimes including the nutritional values and sometimes not. you're also limited to a certain amount of responses before the chat ends.

# Google Gemini
Also didn't work, message:
`I'm sorry. I'm not able to access the website(s) you've provided. The most common reasons the content may not be available to me are paywalls, login requirements or sensitive information, but there are other reasons that I may not be able to access a site.`
