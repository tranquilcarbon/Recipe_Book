# Description
> These are classic, no-frills, from-scratch cinnamon rolls. It's one of the earliest recipes we committed to our recipe book and unfortunately we neglected to credit the recipe's source when we wrote it down... Sorry! The recipe also includes directions for a thick and rich cream cheese frosting to layer on top after baking and cooling - our favorite variation is to serve half of the rolls with orange extract and food coloring added!
> 
> Ingredients and directions are divided into three sections: one each for dough, filling, and frosting. So, be careful to read all three cards to get the total amount of ingredients!
