# Room temperature
## Duration:
2-3 Weeks
## Works Best with:
Most cookies, especially those with a low moisture content like chocolate chip, oatmeal, and sugar cookies.
## Special Handling
- Allow cookies to cool completely before storing to prevent condensation and sogginess.
- Store in an airtight container to maintain freshness.
- Add a layer of grease proof paper between layers to absorb excess moisture.
# Refrigerator
## Duration:
2-4 weeks
## Works Best with:
Cookies with perishable ingredients such as cream cheese, custard, or frosting.

## Special Handling
- Ensure cookies are completely cooled before placing them in the refrigerator.
- Use airtight containers or plastic wrap to prevent drying out.
- Place parchment paper between layers if stacking to prevent sticking.
# Freezer
## Duration:
6-12 months
## Works Best with:
Almost all types of cookies, especially if you want to make them well in advance.
## Special Handling
- Freeze cookies in a single layer on a baking sheet before transferring to a freezer-safe bag or container to prevent sticking.
- Label containers with the date and type of cookie.
- To thaw, leave cookies at room temperature for a few hours or heat in a low oven (around 300°F or 150°C) for a few minutes to refresh their texture.
# Special Considerations for Certain Ingredients
- **Nuts and Dried Fruits:** These can turn rancid if not stored properly. Keep cookies containing these ingredients in the refrigerator for longer shelf life.
- **Chocolate:** Can bloom (white film on the surface) if subjected to temperature changes. Keep cookies with chocolate at a consistent cool temperature. Chocolate that has bloomed is still safe to eat.
- **Cream Cheese or Dairy-Based Fillings:** Always store in the refrigerator or freeze to prevent spoilage.
# General Tips
- **Avoid Sunlight and Heat:** Store cookies in a cool, dark place to prevent melting or spoilage.
- **Check for Staleness or Mold:** Regularly check stored cookies for any signs of spoilage.
- **Separate Strong Flavors:** Store cookies with strong flavors (e.g., peppermint) separately to avoid flavor transfer.
