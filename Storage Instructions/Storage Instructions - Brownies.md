# Room temperature
## Duration:
3 - 4 Days
## Works Best with:
Brownies without perishable ingredients, like traditional chocolate or fudge brownies.
## Special Handling
- Allow brownies to cool completely before storing to prevent condensation.
- Store in an airtight container to maintain freshness.
- You can layer them with parchment paper to prevent sticking.
- Keep the container in a cool, dark place.
# Refrigerator
## Duration:
1- 2 Weeks
## Works Best with:
Brownies with perishable ingredients such as cream cheese, frosting, or fruit fillings.
## Special Handling
- Ensure brownies are fully cooled before placing them in the refrigerator.
- Wrap each brownie individually in plastic wrap or store in an airtight container to prevent drying out.
- Place parchment paper between layers if stacking to avoid sticking.
# Freezer
## Duration:
3 - 4 Months
## Works Best with:
All types of brownies, especially if you want to store them for a longer period.
## Special Handling
- Freeze brownies in a single layer on a baking sheet before transferring them to a freezer-safe bag or container. This prevents them from sticking together.
- Wrap each brownie individually in plastic wrap and then place them in a freezer-safe bag or container for extra protection.
- Label the container with the date and type of brownie.
- To thaw, leave brownies at room temperature for a few hours or heat in a low oven (around 300°F or 150°C) for a few minutes to refresh their texture.
# Special Considerations for Certain Ingredients
- **Cream Cheese or Dairy-Based Fillings:** Brownies with these fillings should always be stored in the refrigerator or freezer to prevent spoilage.
- **Fruits and Jams:** If your brownies contain fresh fruit or fruit preserves, they should be refrigerated or frozen as these ingredients can spoil quickly.
- **Nuts:** While nuts don't spoil quickly, they can turn rancid. Store nut-containing brownies in an airtight container and consider refrigerating them for longer shelf life.
- **Frosting or Ganache:** If brownies are topped with frosting or ganache, they should be refrigerated or frozen to keep the topping from spoiling or becoming too soft.
# General Tips
- **Avoid Heat and Sunlight:** Keep brownies in a cool, dark place to prevent melting or spoilage.
- **Check for Freshness:** Regularly check stored brownies for any signs of staleness or mold.
- **Proper Wrapping:** Ensure brownies are wrapped properly to avoid exposure to air, which can dry them out and affect texture.
