# Room Temperature Storage
**Duration:** 1-2 days

**Best for:** Cakes without perishable ingredients, like plain sponge cakes or those with buttercream frosting.

**Special Handling Instructions:**

- Ensure the cake is completely cooled before storing to prevent condensation and sogginess.
- Store in an airtight container or cover with plastic wrap to maintain freshness.
- Keep in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat.

# Refrigerator Storage

**Duration:** 3-7 days

**Best for:** Cakes with perishable ingredients such as cream cheese frosting, custard, fruit fillings, or fresh fruits.

**Special Handling Instructions:**

- Allow the cake to cool completely before placing it in the refrigerator.
- Wrap the cake in plastic wrap or store in an airtight container to prevent it from drying out.
- If the cake is frosted, place it in the refrigerator uncovered for 15 minutes to let the frosting harden, then cover it lightly with plastic wrap or store it in a cake keeper.

# Freezer Storage

**Duration:** 2-4 months

**Best for:** Almost all types of cakes, especially if you want to store them for a longer period.

**Special Handling Instructions:**

- Freeze unfrosted cakes by wrapping each layer tightly in plastic wrap, then in aluminum foil or a freezer-safe bag.
- For frosted cakes, place the cake in the freezer for about an hour to harden the frosting, then wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil or place it in a freezer-safe container.
- Label with the date and type of cake.
- To thaw, transfer the cake to the refrigerator overnight or let it sit at room temperature for a few hours.

## Special Considerations for Certain Ingredients

- **Cream Cheese or Dairy-Based Fillings/Frostings:** Always store these cakes in the refrigerator to prevent spoilage.
- **Fresh Fruits or Fruit Fillings:** Cakes with fresh fruits or fruit fillings should be refrigerated or frozen, as these ingredients spoil quickly.
- **Whipped Cream Frosting:** Cakes with whipped cream frosting should be kept in the refrigerator and consumed within 1-2 days.
- **Ganache or Mousse:** Store these cakes in the refrigerator as the fillings are perishable.

# General Tips

- **Avoid Strong Odors:** Store cakes away from strong-smelling foods in the refrigerator to prevent odor absorption.
- **Check for Freshness:** Regularly check stored cakes for any signs of staleness or mold.
- **Proper Wrapping:** Ensure cakes are wrapped properly to avoid exposure to air, which can dry them out and affect texture.
- **Prevent Drying Out:** When storing sliced cake, press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the exposed cake sides to prevent them from drying out.

By following these guidelines, you can keep your cakes fresh and delicious for an extended period, ensuring they retain their flavor and texture.
