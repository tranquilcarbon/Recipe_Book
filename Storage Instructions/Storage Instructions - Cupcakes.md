### Room Temperature Storage

**Duration:** 1-2 days

**Best for:** Cupcakes with non-perishable frostings like buttercream or fondant.

**Special Handling Instructions:**

- Allow cupcakes to cool completely before storing to prevent condensation.
- Store in an airtight container to maintain freshness and prevent them from drying out.
- If frosted, arrange cupcakes in a single layer, making sure the frosting does not touch the lid or sides of the container.
- Keep in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat.

### Refrigerator Storage

**Duration:** 3-5 days

**Best for:** Cupcakes with perishable ingredients like cream cheese frosting, custard, fruit fillings, or fresh fruits.

**Special Handling Instructions:**

- Allow cupcakes to cool completely before placing them in the refrigerator.
- Store in an airtight container to prevent drying out. If frosted, arrange cupcakes in a single layer, ensuring the frosting does not touch the lid or sides.
- If the frosting is soft, refrigerate the cupcakes uncovered for about 15 minutes to firm up the frosting before covering them.

### Freezer Storage

**Duration:** 2-3 months

**Best for:** All types of cupcakes, especially if you want to store them for a longer period.

**Special Handling Instructions:**

- Freeze unfrosted cupcakes by wrapping each cupcake individually in plastic wrap and then placing them in a freezer-safe bag or container.
- For frosted cupcakes, place them in the freezer uncovered for about an hour to harden the frosting. Then wrap each cupcake individually in plastic wrap and place them in a freezer-safe bag or container.
- Label with the date and type of cupcake.
- To thaw, transfer cupcakes to the refrigerator overnight or let them sit at room temperature for a few hours.

### Special Considerations for Certain Ingredients

- **Cream Cheese or Dairy-Based Frostings:** Always store cupcakes with these frostings in the refrigerator or freezer to prevent spoilage.
- **Fresh Fruits or Fruit Fillings:** Cupcakes with fresh fruits or fruit fillings should be refrigerated or frozen, as these ingredients can spoil quickly.
- **Whipped Cream Frosting:** Store cupcakes with whipped cream frosting in the refrigerator and consume within 1-2 days.
- **Mousse or Ganache:** Store these cupcakes in the refrigerator as the fillings are perishable.

### General Tips

- **Avoid Strong Odors:** Store cupcakes away from strong-smelling foods in the refrigerator to prevent odor absorption.
- **Check for Freshness:** Regularly check stored cupcakes for any signs of staleness or mold.
- **Proper Wrapping:** Ensure cupcakes are wrapped properly to avoid exposure to air, which can dry them out and affect texture.
- **Prevent Drying Out:** If storing sliced cupcakes or those with an exposed surface, press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the exposed cake to prevent them from drying out.
