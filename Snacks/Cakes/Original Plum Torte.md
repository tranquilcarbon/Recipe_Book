# Description
The Times published Marian Burros’s recipe for Plum Torte every September from 1983 until 1989, when the editors determined that enough was enough. The recipe was to be printed for the last time that year. “To counter anticipated protests,” Ms. Burros wrote a few years later, “the recipe was printed in larger type than usual with a broken-line border around it to encourage clipping.” It didn’t help. The paper was flooded with angry letters. “The appearance of the recipe, like the torte itself, is bittersweet,” wrote a reader in Tarrytown, N.Y. “Summer is leaving, fall is coming. That's what your annual recipe is all about. Don't be grumpy about it.” We are not! And we pledge that every year, as summer gives way to fall, we will make sure that the recipe is easily available to one and all. The original 1983 recipe called for 1 cup sugar; the 1989 version reduced that to ¾ cup. We give both options below.

# Alternative Recipes or implementations
[Replace the plums with almost any seasonal fruit: apricots, halved and pitted; cranberries or any summer berry; sliced apples, nectarines, peaches and pears. Canned and frozen fruit can stand in for fresh.](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/dining/marian-burros-plum-torte-recipe.html)

_Made this for the first time using 4 cups of blueberries and raspberries (mixed). It was perfect! - Jane F._

_I’ve been using a version of this for years as a cranberry holiday bread. - Marie Schappert_

_I have made this with about a quart of drained canned fruit of any type, as well as frozen. I can plums, peaches and pears in season, and if a jar fails to seal, you can bake this cake with it rather than reprocess the jar. - Jennifer Robinson_

[Experiment with spices, herbs and extracts: vanilla extract, almond extract, nutmeg, ginger, cardamom, rosemary, orange or lemon zest.](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/dining/marian-burros-plum-torte-recipe.html)

_I add about a half teaspoon of vanilla or almond extract to the batter. This cake is so easy and good. I even memorized the recipe — except my memorization was imperfect and I baked the cake with the fruit on the bottom by accident. It still was delicious! - Jane Eyrehead_

_I added a teaspoon of finely minced fresh rosemary to the batter… nice, subtle flavor. - Gail_

[Play with the flours. You can add almond or cornmeal flour to the all-purpose flour, or swap in gluten-free flour blends, with excellent results.](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/dining/marian-burros-plum-torte-recipe.html) ([Melissa Clark made a version with whole wheat flour.](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015810-crunchy-topped-whole-wheat-plum-cake))

_Made this with gluten-free flour and it turned out Perfectly! Everyone loved it. - Suzanne_

_I substituted 1/2 cup almond meal and 1/2 cup brown rice flour for 1 cup of wheat flour. I also added parchment paper over the greased bottom of the spring pan. It was delicious served warm. - Mari Schappert_

_Made this last night after tasting the one made by our daughter. Used raspberries and blackberries, one basket each, instead of plums, and 1/3 cup cornmeal and 2/3 cup flour. Fantastic!!! The cornmeal adds a very sophisticated “Italian” character to it, very slight crunch, and amazing flavor. - John_

[Double, triple, even quadruple it. The batter scales up like a dream, and the baked cake freezes well.](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/dining/marian-burros-plum-torte-recipe.html)

_This is one of my favorite recipes and has been for many years. In addition to plums, I’ve used blueberries, peaches, apples and various combinations of more than one fruit. It also freezes great. I line the baking dish with aluminum foil and once baked and cooled slightly, turn the baking dish upside down on a plate, peel off the foil, then turn it right-side up on another plate. - Deborah_

_Double the recipe and it fits nicely in 13-by-9-inch disposable aluminum pans. - Nellie Armstrong._

_Think about making two…one is not enough. - Sandra T._

[Change up the pan. The torte can be baked in any dish provided it’s approximately 8 to 10 inches in diameter and oven-safe.](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/dining/marian-burros-plum-torte-recipe.html)

_Make it in any Pyrex, casserole, anything. - Cynthia_

_Used my pie plate because my springform pan was nowhere to be found. - Kelleryjones_

_A 9-inch pan gives greater height and moisture to the tart than a 10-inch pan. - J. David Nelson_
### Notes
To freeze, double-wrap the torte in foil, place in a plastic bag and seal.
