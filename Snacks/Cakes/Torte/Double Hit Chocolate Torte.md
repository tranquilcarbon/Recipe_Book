# Directions
## Chocolate Pastry
1. Pre heat the oven to 190c
2. Cream the castor sugar and butter in a mixer until light and pale in colour, then add the vanilla essence
3. and mix in.
4. Add the flour and cocoa powder gradually, a little at a time until thoroughly combined. Keep mixing until
5. it forms a dough.
6. Grease the fluted tart tin, then press the dough into the sides and all over the base with your fingertips,
7. ensuring the pastry is evenly distributed. Rest the pastry in the fridge for about half an hour or until it
8. has hardened.
9. Place the pastry tart in the oven and bake for approximately 8 minutes, or until the pastry starts to
10. bubble slightly. If the pastry has slipped slightly down the side of the tart tin, press it back into shape
11. with your fingers, using a tea towel if the pastry is too warm. Set aside to cool.
12. Pour 275ml of whipping cream into a small saucepan and place over a medium heat until it starts to
13. simmer (do not boil). Once simmering, place the dark chocolate into a bowl and pour the hot cream
14. over the chocolate, stirring gently to ensure all of the chocolate has melted. Pour the chocolate mixture
15. into the pastry tart. Refrigerate straight away, allowing at least 2 hours for the chocolate to set. Make
16. sure you place the tart on an even surface in the fridge.
17. Pour the rest of the whipping cream with the Camp coffee essence, cinnamon stick and orange peel into
18. a small saucepan and place over a medium heat to simmer (do not boil). Once simmering, remove from
19. the heat and set aside to steep for 30 minutes.
20. Place the cream back over the heat and bring back to simmering point. Once simmering, place the milk
21. chocolate into a bowl and pour the steeped cream over the chocolate, stirring gently to ensure all of the
22. chocolate has melted.
23. Remove the chocolate tart from the fridge and pour the steeped chocolate
24. mixture over the dark chocolate layer.
25. Place the tart back in the fridge for a further 2–3 hours to set.
26. Cut the double hit chocolate torte with a hot knife (this makes it cut easily and cleanly). Serve with ice cream or fresh pouring cream
