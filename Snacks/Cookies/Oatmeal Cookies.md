# Notes
- If you want to prevent the bottoms from getting too crispy, or if your baking sheet is just old, line it with aluminum foil.
- It's hard to go wrong with more vanilla. When adding vanilla extract to the mix, overfill the measuring spoon until it flows over.
- If making more than one kind of cookie that looks similar, use food colouring to distinguish them.
- You can substitute butter 1:1 for shortening, but it will make the cookies flatter and less firm.
- You can substitute 1/2 cup of applesauce for every cup of sugar, but use less butter / oil to compensate for the added moisture. It may take some experimenting to get a good texture. This works best for oatmeal cookies.
