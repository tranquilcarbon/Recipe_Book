# Description
Every once in a while, I get an email from the corporate overlords with suggestions for possible videos. This potato chip cookie recipe is the latest, and probably most delicious, example. I might have eventually thought of adding a ridiculous amount of crushed potato chips to our famous chocolate chip cookie batter, but who knows how long that would have taken? Basically, they’re surfing TikTok so I don’t have to, which I think is a win for everyone involved.

 I’ll admit putting potato chips in cookies sounds a little crazy — but man does it work well. The obvious reason is the extra salt in the batter, but there’s also some very interesting savoriness that’s imparted. As far as the texture goes, you really do have to experience that for yourself, since I find it almost impossible to describe. The potato chips don’t stay crispy, but they do stay sort of crunchy, which makes these one of the most addictive cookies I’ve ever eaten.  So, if you enjoy chocolate chip cookies, and want to enjoy them like you’ve never enjoyed them before, I hope you give these a try soon. Enjoy!

# Directions
1. Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl; set aside.
2. Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add egg and mix until fully incorporated and the mixture is smooth. Add milk and vanilla and repeat. 
3. Stir potato chips and chocolate chips in with a spatula until just combined. Add flour mixture; continue mixing in with a spatula until flour disappears and dough comes together. 
4. Wrap and chill dough for about 30 minutes, or until ready to bake. Dough can be used immediately if desired. 
5. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment. 
6. Scoop dough by rounded tablespoons onto the prepared baking sheet. Space evenly, as dough will spread when baked.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until outside edges of cookies are lightly browned, about 12 minutes. Cool on the pan for about 5 minutes, before removing cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. For best results, let cool completely before serving.

# Notes
- Chef's Note - Feel free to play around with varieties, but what I think works best is a nice, thick crispy kettle chip. I used regular sea salt flavor
- Comments mention lays chips working well, over here in the UK, the equivalent is Walkers Crisps.
