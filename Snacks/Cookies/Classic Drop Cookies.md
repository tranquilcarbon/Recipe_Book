## Substitutions
For classic chocolate chip, use 2 to 2 ½ cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Use this measurement for any "single chip" cookie type. Semi-sweet is recommended over milk chocolate to offset some of the sweetness of the cookie itself.

Other add-ins I recommend, depending on your tastes:

- Walnut chocolate chip (2 cups chocolate chip 1 cup crushed walnuts)
- Chocolate chip + peanut butter chip (1 ½ cup each)
- Mint chocolate chip
- Dark chocolate chip (with or without walnuts)
- White chocolate chip (with or without macadamia nuts)
- Butterscotch chip (with or without walnuts / pecans)
- Butterscotch chip + chocolate chip + white chocolate chip(¾ cup of each)
- Heath / toffee chip
# Directions
1. Preheat oven to 375°F.
2. Mix sugars together in a large mixing bowl.
3. Add melted butter, eggs, and vanilla extract, and beat until thoroughly mixed.
4. Stir in baking soda and salt.
5. Gradually add flour, beating until the dough has an even texture.
6. Add desired add-ins, and stir until evenly distributed in the dough.
7. Drop dough onto an ungreased cookie sheet, about 1" in diameter and about 2" apart. Use a tablespoon to measure if you like.
8. Bake each sheet for 9 to 11 minutes or until golden brown.
9. Place on wire racks to cool.

# Notes
- If you want to prevent the bottoms from getting too crispy, or if your baking sheet is just old, line it with aluminum foil.
- It's hard to go wrong with more vanilla. When adding vanilla extract to the mix, overfill the measuring spoon until it flows over.
- If making more than one kind of cookie that looks similar, use food colouring to distinguish them.
- You can substitute butter 1:1 for shortening, but it will make the cookies flatter and less firm.
- You can substitute 1/2 cup of applesauce for every cup of sugar, but use less butter / oil to compensate for the added moisture. It may take some experimenting to get a good texture. This works best for oatmeal cookies.
