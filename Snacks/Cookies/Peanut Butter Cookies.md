## Substitutions / Optional

# Directions
1. Mix sugars together in a large mixing bowl.
2. Add peanut butter, shortening, melted butter, and egg, and beat until thoroughly mixed.
3. Stir in baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
4. Gradually add flour, beating until the dough has an even texture.
5. Cover bowl with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and set in the fridge for a minimum of 2 hours. Dough will be stiff and moldable but a little sticky when ready.
6. When dough is ready, preheat oven to 375Â°F.
7. Scoop dough and roll into 1" balls in your hands. You may need to use a spoon or an ice cream scooper.
8. Place the balls of dough onto an ungreased baking sheet about 2" apart.
9. Dip a fork in granulated sugar, and use it to press each cookie once vertically and once horizontally, making a cross-hatch pattern. When all of them are pressed, sprinkle a pinch of sugar over the batch.
10. Bake each sheet for 9 to 10 minutes or until golden brown.
11. Place on wire racks to cool.
