# Description
Rich semi-sweet chocolate cookies; I get a lot of requests for this one when I do big bakes. For darker chocolate cookies, use less granulated sugar.

#### Total Time

### Servings
3 ~ 4 Dozen

## Nutritional Information

# Ingredients
1 cup cocoa powder  
1 1/2 cup granulated sugar  
1/2 cup vegetable oil  
4 eggs  
2 tsp vanilla extract  
2 tsp baking powder  
1/2 tsp salt  
2 cups flour  
1 cup powdered sugar
## Substitutions / Optional
- Mini chocolate chips (1 to 2 cups)
- Espresso powder (1 tsp)
# Directions
1. Mix the cocoa and sugar together in a large bowl, then stir in the oil until you get a gritty chocolate paste.
2. Add the eggs, vanilla extract and beat until thoroughly mixed.
3. Stir in baking powder, salt, and any add-ins.
4. Gradually add flour, beating until the dough has an even texture.
5. Cover bowl with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and set in the fridge for a minimum of 4 hours. Dough will be stiff and moldable but a little sticky when ready.
6. When dough is ready, preheat oven to 350Â°F and pour powdered sugar onto a flat surface, like a plate or clean counter.
7. Get some powdered sugar on your hands, and use them to scoop out clumps of the dough, rolling it into 1" balls in your palms and then rolling those balls in the powdered sugar until covered.
8. Place the balls of dough onto an ungreased baking sheet about 2" apart. You may be able to fit more than 12.
9. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until bottoms are firm and cracks appear in the sugar crust.
10. Place on wire racks to cool.

# Notes
- If you want to prevent the bottoms from getting too crispy, or if your baking sheet is just old, line it with aluminum foil.
- It's hard to go wrong with more vanilla. When adding vanilla extract to the mix, overfill the measuring spoon until it flows over.
- If making more than one kind of cookie that looks similar, use food colouring to distinguish them.
- You can substitute butter 1:1 for shortening, but it will make the cookies flatter and less firm.
- You can substitute 1/2 cup of applesauce for every cup of sugar, but use less butter / oil to compensate for the added moisture. It may take some experimenting to get a good texture. This works best for oatmeal cookies.
