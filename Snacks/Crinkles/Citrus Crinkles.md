## Substitutions / Optional

# Directions
1. Zest the fruit using a knife, peeler, or zester and set aside. Zest should be in small pieces, so dice if necessary.
2. Juice the fruit into a small bowl. Some pulp is fine, but remove seeds.
3. Mix sugar, melted butter, and egg in a large mixing bowl.
4. Stir in the juice (about 1/2 cup if juicing a larger fruit), zest, and vanilla extract.
5. Stir in baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
6. Gradually add flour, beating until the dough has an even texture.
7. Cover bowl with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and set in the fridge for a minimum of 2 hours. Dough will be stiff and moldable when ready.
8. When dough is ready, preheat oven to 350Â°F and pour powdered sugar onto a flat surface, like a plate or clean counter.
9. Get some powdered sugar on your hands, and use them to scoop out clumps of the dough, rolling it into 1" balls in your palms and then rolling those balls in the powdered sugar until covered.
10. Place the balls of dough onto an ungreased baking sheet about 2" apart. You may be able to fit more than 12.
11. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until bottoms are firm and cracks appear in the sugar crust.
12. Place on wire racks to cool.
