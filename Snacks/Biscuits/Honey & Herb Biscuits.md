# Ingredients
- 7 ½ cups (900g) flour
- ¼ cup (30g) finely chopped fresh rosemary
- 3 tbsp (45g) baking powder
- 2 tsp (10g) finely chopped fresh thyme
- 2 tsp (10g) kosher salt
- 1 tsp (5g) baking soda
- 1 tsp (5g) freshly ground black pepper
- ¾ cup (150g) unsalted butter, cut into small cubes and chilled
- 2 cups (472mL) buttermilk
- ¾ cup (177mL) half-and-half
- ¼ cup (60mL) honey

# Directions
**1.** Heat oven to 375F (190g).
**2.** Whisk together flour, rosemary, baking powder, thyme, salt, baking soda, and pepper in a large bowl.
**3.** Add butter and, using your fingers, rub butter into flour mixture until pea-size crumbles form.
**4.** In a medium bowl, whisk together buttermilk, half-and-half, and honey, add to dry ingredients and stir together with a fork until just combined.
**5.** Transfer dough to a well-floured surface, and pat out into a one inch (2.5cm)-thick disk. Using a 3-inch (7.5cm) round cutter, cut out biscuits and transfer to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, arranging them so their edges touch. Reroll scraps and cut out more biscuits until all of the dough is used.
**6.** Bake until golden brown, about 35 minutes.
