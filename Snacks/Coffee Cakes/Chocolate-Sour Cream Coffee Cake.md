# Notes
Quick-rising coffee cakes do not store very well.  You should serve them immediately (or at least soon) after baking.

Yeast coffee cakes will store and reheat well.

If you have fruit in your coffee cake the flavour will mellow during storage and your coffee cake  will taste better.

If you want to have a very golden-colored crumb, in just about any coffee cake,  
you can add a dash of saffron to the batter.
