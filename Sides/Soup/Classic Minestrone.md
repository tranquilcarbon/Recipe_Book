# Description
I first used this minestrone recipe to break in a new multicooker that I got for my 26th birthday :)

Our seasonal vegetables included black beans, red potatoes, and spinach - paired with tortellini this created more of a stew as the broth had plenty of starchy carbs to soak itself into. The flexibility of this recipe is apparant and its rich and varied flavor made it an instant hit in our home.

Diet permitting, I highly recommend serving this Genovese-style with parmesan and pesto added on top when plating. These additions really kick up the umami saltiness and make this a truly 5â˜… meal.
