# Description
Move over picky eaters and food waste, because kebabs are here to save the day! Kebabs can be one of the best foods for a BBQ, because you can make them with whatever meat and veg you like, and whip them into such a wonder that even the kids who only want chicken nuggets can’t say no.

# Ingredients
- 8 boneless and skinless chicken thigh fillets
- 425g can pineapple chunks in juice (drain and set the juice to one side)
- 100g Anchor spreadable or block butter

Our pineapple chicken kebabs are delish, but you may want to chop and change some of the ingredients. If so, here are some BBQ kebab ideas to replace any of the ingredients from our recipe:

- Beef
- Lamb
- Pork
- Sausage
- Chorizo
- Halloumi
- Paneer
- Red onion
- Courgette
- Slices of corn on the cob
- New potatoes
- Mushrooms
- Mango (yes, really!)

If you swap out ingredients, just remember that cooking times might vary. Make sure that your kebabs are fully cooked all the way through before plating them up and serving!

# Directions
1. Light up those coals and oil your grill ready for a BBQ banquet fit for a king!
2. Beat Anchor spreadable with a wooden spoon until smooth and add sweet chilli, soy, garlic powder, and half the pineapple juice, then whisk. Cut each thigh into 3 chunks and throw into the bowl. Get your sleeves rolled up - it's time to get messy. Use your hands to coat the chicken in that sweet and tangy coating - go on, don't be shy!
3. Pop your peppers and pineapple chunks in a bowl with the rest of the pineapple juice, a glug of olive oil, and some salt and pepper. Give 'em a shimmy until fully covered.
4. Now to get threading. Pop your chicken thigh chunks, pineapple, and pepper onto your skewers. Repeat until you have 6 to 8 fully loaded kebabs!
5. Time to get grilling. Add your kebabs to the BBQ, topping them with your leftover buttery coating. Leave for 5 mins before turning and cooking for another 10 mins. Keep turning and adding that buttery goodness for extra juiciness!
6. You can check your kebabs are done when the internal temp is 75 °C (165 °F). Once they're done, you're ready to say 'aloha' to the best kebab in town. Get dunking in sour cream mixed with sweet chilli for a little extra sizzle.

# Notes
- if using wooden skewers, keep them from burning by soaking in water for 10 mins before putting on the BBQ!
- The easiest way to put your kebabs together is to create little stations for each of your kebab ingredients – for example, you can have one area for your chicken, one for your bell peppers, and one for your pineapple. Slice up each of your ingredients one at a time (making sure to clean your chopping board in between!), then just grab an ingredient from each section and stick it on your skewer!
- When it comes to cooking your kebabs, the key is in the consistency. Because there are so many different types of meat and veg (and in the case of our Hawaiian chicken kebabs, fruit!), you want to keep a close eye on them to make sure they’re all barbequing evenly by turning the kebab skewers often, around every 5 minutes or so.
- Pro tip - make sure you keep slathering on that delicious marinade to keep them juicy – if you're out of the pineapple mixture you could always try our cheeky cajun butter!
