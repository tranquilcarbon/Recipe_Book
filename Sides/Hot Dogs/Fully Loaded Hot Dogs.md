# Directions
- Get the firelighters out and the coals on - you're about to make BBQ history!
- Cut lengthways down the centre of each sausage like a finger roll - but only go halfway. Mix Anchor, cheddar, garlic, and chilli, then stuff the mixture down the centre of each sausage.
- Wrap the stuffed sausages snuggly in their bacon blankets. Quick tip - pierce a skewer lengthways down the centre of each stuffed dog to make them easier to flip!
- Pop on the oiled BBQ and sizzle for 15 mins until cooked (the internal temp should be 71 °C and 160 °F).
- Job done! Pop your dogs into their buns and get topping with cheese, onions, nachos, and jalapenos. The real question is, can you handle the heat?

# Notes
How you make hot dogs depends on the type of sausage you’re working with. There’s a huge variety of sausages to choose from, but in British BBQs, we tend to go for the good ol’ Cumberland. These sausages, and others like them – for example, pork, chipolatas, Lincolnshire – are perfectly fine to be grilled on the BBQ. Just pop them on, add some buttery marinade, and turn them every so often until they’re lovely and golden.

However, if you prefer more of a classic American Frankfurter style hot dog, you’re probably buying your sausages in brine in a tin or jar. The best way to cook these are to boil them, but this doesn’t stop you from including them in the BBQ! Simply grab a pot or pan from the kitchen (but make sure it's safe to use on the grill!), fill it with boiled water and (carefully!) tip in your hot dogs with the brine. Pop it on your BBQ grill and enjoy once cooked!
