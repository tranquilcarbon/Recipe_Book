# Notes

- place your leftovers in an air-tight container and pop in the fridge or freezer for next time!

- If you’re running low on time, you can marinate by simply grabbing a pastry brush, dipping it in your marinade, and slathering it over your meat and veg on the BBQ, letting it settle in for around a minute before turning and marinating the other side.

- If you have a little more time to prepare, you can make sure your meat really soaks up all that lovely flavour by placing it in the marinade overnight. Simply lay your meat in a bowl and pour over the marinade, rubbing it slightly to make sure it’s totally covered. Then cover your bowl with cling film or a bowl cover and leave it to have a lovely spicy seasoning bath overnight. This method is super effective for marinating chicken for the BBQ, as chicken can take longer to absorb the flavours.
