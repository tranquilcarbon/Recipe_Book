# Description
A good marinade can make or break a British BBQ. If you really want your food to pop, a marinade is what you need to turn bland chicken, pork, or beef into juicy, buttery betterness.

# Ingredients
- 6 large flat mushrooms, stalk removed
- 150g [[Cheeky Cajun Butter Marinade]]
- 200g grated cheddar
- 2 tsp chilli flakes
- Big splash of Worcester sauce
- 100g crispy fried onions

## Substitutions / Optional

# Directions
- Get your BBQ lit and your plates ready to be blessed with buttery mushroom goodness.
- Mix Anchor Cajun butter (see recipe) with cheddar, chilli, and Worcester sauce. Stuff each mushroom, and top with crispy fried onion. Don't forget to give them a cheeky little season!
- Chuck onto the BBQ and cook for 6-8 mins until the cheese is bubbling and oozing. Bish, bash, bosh - that's our kinda nosh!

How long you cook stuffed mushrooms on the BBQ for can vary depending on how you like them! If you like ‘em juicy, aim for around 6 minutes on the grill. If you prefer crispy and well-done, wait until around the 8–10 minute mark to take your stuffed mushrooms off and start snacking.

**Anchor Hack Alert** - these aren't just for the veggies! Why not use these mushrooms as burger buns for your beef for the ultimate burger twist!
